Problem Statement
Build a UI for creating and configuring Creatives. A Creatives is a container/box that contains a title and subtitle with a background color.

Product Features
Creative Dashboard
1. The dashboard loads with an empty list of Creatives. A progress bar indicates how many Creatives have been created so far. A maximum total of 20 creatives are allowed.
2. An "Add Creative" button can be used by the user to open the Creative Creation Drawer. When the drawer is closed the dashboard will take 100% width.
3. The UI also provided a means to filter the list of Creatives via color and text.
  a. User can able to select mutiple colors for filtering the list.
  b. List can be filtered using  only colour, only text and  by color and text both.

Creative Creation Drawer
4. Clicking on the Add Creative button will change the layout of the page by opening a drawer.
5. For creating the creatives we have to fill the required filed( like title, sub-title and background color) of creative creation drawer.
6. On filling the required filed and on clicking the done button, creative creation drawer will get closed and a Creatives  which is a container/box that contains a title and subtitle with a background color will get displayed to creative dashboard. In order to add more creatives to the creative dashboard we again click on the add creative button which will open the creative creation drawer and after filling the required filed and on clicking the done button again a new creative will get created and will get displayed to creative dashboard . In this way we can add up to 20 creatives to our dashboard.
